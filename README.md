# imageclassifier-tflite
Image classifier deployed on Android Studio emulator 
Reproduced from tensorflow.org codelab at https://developer.android.com/codelabs/digit-classifier-tflite#0
Implemented model version 1 using original digits from the dataset and version 2 using augmented data.
The prediction made on the augmented train anf test data is attached.
The GPU engine on my laptop intermittently failed to bring up the emulator.
This can serve as a prototype for image classification problems.
